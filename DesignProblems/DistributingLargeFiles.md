# Design an Optimized Way of Distributing Large Files

Jingle collects breaking news articles at its lab machine—roughly 1,000 articles per minute, each 100 KB in size (≈100 MB/min total). These files must be copied to a data center with 1,000 servers, where every server should hold a local copy of the newly added articles. The lab machine is far from the data center, but within the data center, servers have high-speed interconnects. The challenge is to efficiently distribute these files from the lab server to all data center servers with minimal latency and efficient network usage.

## **1. Clarify Requirements**
- **Functional Requirements:**
    - **File Size and Rate:** 1,000 articles/minute at 100 KB each.
    - **Replication:** Every one of the 1,000 data center servers must eventually receive each new article.
    - **Timeliness:** Distribution should be fast to keep content “fresh.”
- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
    - **Efficiency:** Minimize redundant data transfers across the wide-area network (WAN) between the lab and data center.
    - **Scalability:** Efficiently scale to a large number of destination servers.
    - **Reliability:** Ensure robust and fault-tolerant delivery.
- **Key Consideration:**
    - The high-speed, low-latency network within the data center can be exploited to perform rapid intra-data center distribution once a file arrives.

## **2. Overall Approach**
1. **Single Ingress Point:**
    - Transfer the new articles from the lab machine to one or a small number of entry servers in the data center over the WAN.
    - This minimizes the number of WAN connections and the total WAN bandwidth usage.
2. **Tree-Based Replication within the Data Center:**
    - Once an article is available on the entry server(s), use the data center’s high-speed internal network to disseminate the files using a tree-based (multicast-like) replication approach.
    - Each server forwards the files to a set of peers until all 1,000 servers have a copy.
3. **Pipelining and Parallelism:**
    - Process files in batches (or pipelines) to maximize throughput.
    - Overlap WAN transfers with intra-data center replication.

## **3. Detailed System Architecture**

### **3.1. WAN Ingress**
- **Lab to Data Center Gateway:**
    - The lab machine sends the batch of 1,000 articles to a designated gateway server or a small cluster of ingress servers in the data center.
    - Use efficient protocols (e.g., HTTP/2, gRPC, or specialized file transfer tools) with compression if applicable.
- **Minimized WAN Usage:**
    - Instead of having the lab push 1,000 separate transfers to 1,000 servers, it only transfers once (or to a few gateways), reducing WAN bandwidth usage and latency.

### **3.2. Intra-Data Center Replication**
- **Tree-Based Distribution:**
    - **Step 1:** The gateway server receives the new articles.
    - **Step 2:** The gateway server forwards the files to a selected set of peer servers (e.g., it sends to 10 servers).
    - **Step 3:** Each of those 10 servers further forwards the files to a group of servers, continuing in a tree (or cascade) pattern.
    - **Step 4:** Continue until all 1,000 servers have the file.
- **Replication Topology:**
    - Organize servers in a balanced tree structure where each node forwards the file to a fixed number of children.
    - Example: A 10-ary tree where one node sends to 10 nodes, each of which sends to another 10, etc. This minimizes replication rounds (logarithmic in the number of servers).
- **Parallel and Pipelined Transfers:**
    - Multiple articles can be pipelined simultaneously, taking advantage of the data center’s internal bandwidth.

### **3.3. Fault Tolerance and Reliability**
- **Redundancy:**
    - If a server in the replication tree fails, use alternate paths to ensure that the file reaches all servers.
- **Acknowledgments and Retries:**
    - Each replication step should involve acknowledgment of successful receipt, with retries if necessary.
- **Monitoring:**
    - Implement monitoring of transfer status, error logging, and automated recovery procedures.

## **4. Trade-Offs and Considerations**
- **Centralized Ingress vs. Distributed Ingress:**
    - Using a single gateway minimizes WAN connections but creates a potential single point of failure. This can be mitigated by having a small, redundant ingress cluster.
- **Tree Branching Factor:**
    - Choosing an optimal branching factor in the replication tree balances the number of hops with the load on each server.
- **Latency vs. Bandwidth:**
    - The solution minimizes WAN latency by using a single transfer and leverages the high-speed internal network for distribution.

## **5. Summary**
This design efficiently distributes 1,000 files (each 100 KB) per minute from a remote lab server to 1,000 data center servers by:
- Transferring files once over the WAN to a designated gateway or ingress server(s).
- Using a tree-based, cascaded replication method within the data center to rapidly and reliably copy the files to all servers.
  This approach minimizes WAN bandwidth consumption, exploits high-speed data center networking, and ensures that new articles are quickly and reliably available on all servers for serving breaking news.
