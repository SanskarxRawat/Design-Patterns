# Implement PageRank

The PageRank algorithm assigns a rank to a web page based on the number of "important" pages that link to it. To compute PageRank over a web graph of ten billion pages, we need to design a distributed system that leverages an ensemble of machines and efficient data structures.

## **1. Clarify Requirements**
- **Functional Requirements:**
    - Build the link structure matrix (A) from the hyperlink graph where:
        - For page j linking to page i, A[i][j] = 1/(# of links from page j)
    - Compute the PageRank vector X satisfying:
        - X = ε * [1] + (1-ε) * A * X
        - Iteratively update: X<sub>k</sub> = ε * [1] + (1-ε) * A * X<sub>k-1</sub>
    - Convergence criteria: Stop when the difference between successive iterations is below a given threshold.

- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
    - **Scalability:** Handle 10 billion pages across multiple machines.
    - **Performance:** Compute PageRank in a reasonable amount of time.
    - **Fault Tolerance:** Tolerate failures in distributed processing.
    - **Efficiency:** Use memory- and communication-efficient data structures and algorithms.

- **Questions to Ask:**
    - What is the acceptable convergence threshold?
    - What is the value of ε (commonly around 0.15)?
    - How frequently will the web graph be updated and recomputed?
    - What are the resource limits (RAM, network bandwidth) on each machine?

## **2. Key Components**
1. **Distributed Graph Storage:**
    - Store the web graph and the corresponding link structure.
    - Partition the graph across machines (e.g., using a hash-based or range-based partitioning).
2. **Matrix Representation and Data Structures:**
    - Represent matrix A in a sparse format (e.g., Compressed Sparse Column/Row) to handle billions of pages.
    - Use a key-value store or distributed file system to store partitions.
3. **Distributed Iterative Computation Engine:**
    - Perform the iterative multiplication X = ε*[1] + (1-ε)AX using distributed computing frameworks (e.g., MapReduce, Spark, or a custom MPI-based solution).
4. **Convergence Monitor:**
    - Track convergence across iterations (e.g., L1 or L2 norm difference between successive iterations).
5. **Fault Tolerance & Recovery:**
    - Checkpoint intermediate results.
    - Handle machine failures and re-distribute work as needed.

## **3. High-Level Design**
- **Input:**
    - Web graph data with 10 billion pages and hyperlinks.
- **Processing Pipeline:**
    1. **Graph Partitioning & Loading:**
        - Partition the web graph and distribute the link structure (sparse matrix A) across the ensemble.
    2. **Initialization:**
        - Set initial PageRank vector X<sub>0</sub> with each component equal to 1/n.
    3. **Iterative Computation:**
        - On each iteration, compute X<sub>k</sub> = ε * [1] + (1-ε) * A * X<sub>k-1</sub> in parallel.
        - Use efficient sparse matrix-vector multiplication.
    4. **Convergence Check:**
        - Calculate the difference between X<sub>k</sub> and X<sub>k-1</sub> across all machines.
        - Stop iterations when the difference is below a threshold.
    5. **Output:**
        - Final PageRank vector for all 10 billion pages.
- **Output:**
    - A ranking score for each web page that can be stored in a distributed database.

## **4. Deep Dive into Critical Components**

### **4.1 Distributed Graph Storage**
- **Data Structures:**
    - Use a distributed key-value store or HDFS to store partitions.
    - Each partition stores a subset of pages and their outlinks.
- **Partitioning Strategy:**
    - Ensure load balancing by evenly distributing pages.
    - Minimize cross-machine communication by grouping pages with heavy interlinking on the same node if possible.

### **4.2 Sparse Matrix Representation**
- **Representation:**
    - Store only non-zero entries using formats like CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) or CSC (Compressed Sparse Column).
- **Benefits:**
    - Reduces memory footprint significantly.
    - Speeds up sparse matrix-vector multiplication.

### **4.3 Distributed Iterative Computation Engine**
- **Framework:**
    - Utilize MapReduce, Apache Spark, or a custom distributed processing system.
- **Computation:**
    - **Map Step:** Each machine processes its partition and computes partial contributions to the new PageRank vector.
    - **Reduce Step:** Aggregate contributions across partitions to update the global PageRank vector.
- **Optimization:**
    - Use in-memory computation to avoid excessive disk I/O.
    - Use combiners or local aggregation to reduce network communication.

### **4.4 Convergence Monitor**
- **Approach:**
    - After each iteration, compute the norm (L1/L2) of the difference vector.
    - Use a distributed reduction to combine partial differences.
- **Thresholding:**
    - Set a convergence threshold (e.g., when the sum of differences is less than a small constant).

### **4.5 Fault Tolerance**
- **Mechanisms:**
    - Regularly checkpoint intermediate PageRank vectors.
    - Leverage the distributed framework's fault tolerance features (e.g., re-execution of failed tasks).
    - Maintain a log of progress for recovery in case of failures.

---

## **5. Scalability & Performance**
- **Parallelism:**
    - Leverage data parallelism by splitting the graph and processing in parallel.
- **Communication:**
    - Optimize inter-machine communication by reducing the data transferred during matrix-vector multiplications.
- **Memory Efficiency:**
    - Use sparse representations and in-memory computations to speed up processing.
- **Load Balancing:**
    - Dynamically adjust partitions if some nodes become bottlenecks.

---

## **6. Trade-offs**
- **Precision vs. Speed:**
    - Tighter convergence thresholds yield more precise PageRank values but require more iterations.
- **Resource Usage:**
    - Increased memory usage for in-memory computation versus disk-based approaches that are slower.
- **Framework Choice:**
    - Using a high-level framework (e.g., Spark) simplifies development but may add overhead compared to a custom MPI solution.

---

## **7. Failure Handling**
- **Checkpointing:**
    - Save intermediate PageRank vectors periodically.
- **Task Re-Execution:**
    - Automatically reassign tasks that fail due to node or network issues.
- **Monitoring:**
    - Deploy monitoring tools to track job progress and node health.

## **8. Example Walkthrough**

### **Input:**
- A simplified web graph:
    - Page A links to Pages B and C.
    - Page B links to Page C.
    - Page C links to Page A.
- ε (damping factor) = 0.15, initial PageRank for each page = 1/3.

### **Processing Steps:**
1. **Matrix Construction:**
    - Build matrix A using link structure with normalized link weights.
2. **Initialization:**
    - X<sub>0</sub> = [1/3, 1/3, 1/3].
3. **Iteration:**
    - Compute X<sub>1</sub> = 0.15 * [1, 1, 1] + 0.85 * A * X<sub>0</sub>.
    - Continue iterations until convergence.
4. **Aggregation:**
    - In a distributed system, each partition computes partial results and then aggregates them.
5. **Final Output:**
    - A converged PageRank vector representing the importance of each page.

### **Output:**
```json
{
  "page_ranks": {
    "A": 0.34,
    "B": 0.29,
    "C": 0.37
  },
  "iterations": 15,
  "convergence_threshold": 0.0001
}
