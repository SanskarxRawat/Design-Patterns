# Design a Scalable Priority System

Maintaining a prioritized set of jobs in a distributed environment is challenging when the total number of jobs is in the billions and cannot be stored on a single machine. Applications of such systems include prioritized web crawling in search engines and event-driven simulation in molecular dynamics. The system must support three main operations:
1. **Insert** a new job with a given priority.
2. **Delete** a job by its unique ID.
3. **Find the highest priority job.**

## **1. Clarify Requirements**
- **Functional Requirements:**
    - **Insert:** Add a job with a unique ID and associated priority.
    - **Delete:** Remove a job given its unique ID.
    - **Find Highest:** Retrieve the job with the highest priority.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
    - **Scalability:** Must handle billions of jobs distributed across many machines.
    - **Performance:** Operations should be efficient even in a distributed environment.
    - **Fault Tolerance:** The system should continue functioning if some machines fail.
    - **Consistency:** Ensure that job priorities and ordering remain correct across partitions.
- **Questions to Consider:**
    - Is it acceptable to eventually return a near-highest priority job, or must it always be the absolute highest?
    - How frequently do insertions, deletions, and highest priority queries occur relative to one another?
    - What are the latency constraints for each operation?

## **2. Key Challenges and Considerations**
- **Data Partitioning:**
    - How to partition jobs such that the workload is balanced, yet high-priority jobs can be quickly identified.
- **Global Ordering:**
    - Managing a global order of priorities when data is distributed across multiple nodes.
- **Operation Trade-offs:**
    - It may not be necessary to always operate on the absolute highest priority job if the application allows some tolerance (e.g., “approximate” highest).

---

## **3. Overall Approach**
- **Partitioning by Priority Range:**
    - Divide the entire range of priorities into disjoint intervals. Each machine (or partition) is responsible for jobs whose priorities fall within a specific range.
    - For instance, if priorities range from 1 to 10,000, partition the range into buckets (e.g., 1–1000, 1001–2000, etc.).
- **Local Priority Queues:**
    - Each partition maintains its own priority queue (e.g., a heap) for the jobs in its range.
    - Support fast local insertion, deletion, and retrieval of the highest priority job within that range.
- **Global Coordination:**
    - Maintain a lightweight global index (or metadata service) that tracks which partition currently holds the highest priority job across the entire system.
    - Alternatively, use periodic sampling from partitions to update a global “leader” pointer.
- **API Operations:**
    - **Insert:** Determine the appropriate partition based on the job's priority and insert the job into that partition’s local queue.
    - **Delete:** Use the job’s unique ID to locate the partition (either via a hash table or by storing a mapping in the global metadata service) and then remove the job from the local queue.
    - **Find Highest:** Query the global index to quickly identify the partition that likely contains the highest priority job, then query that partition’s local queue. In some cases, the query may need to check a few adjacent partitions to ensure the absolute highest is returned.

## **4. High-Level Design Components**

### **4.1 Data Partitioning Layer**
- **Partitioning Strategy:**
    - Use a hash function or range partitioning based on job priority.
    - Maintain a mapping (in a distributed key-value store) from priority ranges to specific partitions.
- **Load Balancing:**
    - Adjust partition ranges dynamically if some partitions become overloaded.

### **4.2 Local Priority Queue**
- **Implementation:**
    - Each partition uses an in-memory data structure (such as a heap) to manage its jobs.
    - Support efficient operations: O(log n) insertions and deletions, O(1) retrieval of the highest priority element.
- **Persistence:**
    - Optionally, persist local queues to disk for fault tolerance and recovery.

### **4.3 Global Coordinator / Metadata Service**
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Maintain metadata about which partition holds the current highest priority job.
    - Respond to queries from clients wanting to retrieve the highest priority job.
- **Scalability:**
    - Use a lightweight, replicated service to avoid bottlenecks and ensure high availability.

### **4.4 API Operations**
- **Insert Operation:**
    - **Step 1:** Compute the partition for the new job based on its priority.
    - **Step 2:** Insert the job into the local priority queue of that partition.
    - **Step 3:** Update the global metadata service if the new job's priority is higher than the current global maximum.

- **Delete Operation:**
    - **Step 1:** Locate the partition where the job resides (using a job-to-partition mapping).
    - **Step 2:** Remove the job from the local queue.
    - **Step 3:** If the deleted job was the highest in that partition, refresh the global metadata for that partition.

- **Find Highest Priority Operation:**
    - **Step 1:** Query the global coordinator to identify the partition with the highest candidate.
    - **Step 2:** Retrieve the highest priority job from that partition’s local queue.
    - **Step 3:** Optionally, verify against adjacent partitions if necessary.

## **5. Scalability & Performance Considerations**
- **Distributed Workload:**
    - The use of priority-based partitioning distributes the workload and ensures that no single machine holds all jobs.
- **Latency Minimization:**
    - Local operations are fast because they operate on in-memory queues.
    - The global coordinator is kept lightweight to reduce communication overhead.
- **Fault Tolerance:**
    - Replicate the global metadata service.
    - Periodically checkpoint local priority queues and maintain a mapping for job IDs to their partitions.
- **Eventual Consistency:**
    - The system may use eventual consistency for the global highest priority view if slight staleness is acceptable.

---

## **6. Trade-Offs**
- **Strict Global Ordering vs. Approximate Ordering:**
    - Achieving a perfectly strict global ordering may require heavy synchronization and high latency.
    - For many applications, an approximate highest priority job is acceptable.
- **Centralized Coordinator:**
    - A centralized global coordinator is simpler but may become a bottleneck; using a distributed or partitioned approach increases complexity but improves scalability.
- **Partitioning Granularity:**
    - Fine-grained partitions improve load balancing but complicate global coordination.

## **7. Example Walkthrough**
### **Scenario:**
- A system maintains billions of jobs, each with a unique ID and a priority value between 1 and 10,000.
- The priority ranges are partitioned into ten buckets:
    - Partition 1: 1–1000, Partition 2: 1001–2000, ..., Partition 10: 9001–10000.

### **Insert Operation:**
1. A new job with priority 7500 arrives.
2. It is mapped to Partition 8 (7001–8000).
3. The job is inserted into Partition 8’s local heap.
4. The global coordinator checks if Partition 8 now holds the highest job compared to the current global candidate.

### **Delete Operation:**
1. A job with ID `job123` is to be deleted.
2. The system looks up the partition for `job123` (say, Partition 8).
3. The job is removed from Partition 8’s heap.
4. If `job123` was the highest in Partition 8, the coordinator is updated with the new top job from that partition.

### **Find Highest Priority Operation:**
1. The client requests the highest priority job.
2. The global coordinator identifies Partition 10 as the candidate (holding jobs with priorities in 9001–10000).
3. The highest job from Partition 10 is returned as the highest priority job in the system.

## **8. Summary**
This scalable priority system design partitions jobs across multiple machines based on their priority ranges and maintains local priority queues. A global metadata service or coordinator tracks which partition holds the current highest priority job, enabling efficient insertions, deletions, and retrieval of the highest priority job. This design balances performance and scalability by localizing most operations while allowing slight approximations in global ordering if necessary.
