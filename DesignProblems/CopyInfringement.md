# Design a System for Detecting Copyright Infringement

YouTV.com is an online video sharing site facing copyright infringement issues. Hollywood studios need a feature that allows them to enter a set V of their copyrighted videos and determine which videos in YouTV.com's database match those in V.

---

## **1. Clarify Requirements**
- **Functional Requirements**:
    - Allow a studio to upload a set V of videos (the copyrighted videos).
    - Process and normalize these videos into a standard format.
    - Create unique signatures (fingerprints) for each video in V.
    - Scan YouTV.com's entire video database and identify matches based on the generated signatures.
- **Non-Functional Requirements**:
    - **Scalability**: Efficiently handle a large database of videos.
    - **Accuracy**: High precision in matching to avoid false positives/negatives.
    - **Performance**: Quick response time for detecting matches.
    - **Robustness**: Handle various video formats and quality variations.
- **Questions to Ask**:
    - How many videos are typically in set V and in the entire database?
    - What level of similarity constitutes a match (e.g., exact duplicate, partial reuse)?
    - How frequently do studios want to update their video set V?
    - What are the allowed video formats and codecs?
    - What is the acceptable latency for a matching operation?

3. **Video Database**:
    - Storage for video data and associated signatures.

## **3. High-Level Design**
- **Input**:
    - Studio uploads a set V of videos.
    - YouTV.com database contains millions of user-uploaded videos.
- **Processing**:
    1. **Normalization**: Convert each video to a common format.
    2. **Signature Generation**: Extract key features (e.g., frame hashes, audio fingerprints) to create a compact signature for each video.
    3. **Storage**: Store signatures in an efficient, searchable data structure.
    4. **Matching**: Use a similarity search algorithm to compare signatures from set V with signatures in the database.
- **Output**:
    - A list of videos from YouTV.com that match the uploaded set V, along with a similarity score and match details.

## **4. Deep Dive into Critical Components**

### **4.1 Video Normalization Module**
- **Purpose**: Ensure consistency in video format to enable reliable signature generation.
- **Process**:
    - Convert videos to a standard resolution, frame rate, and codec.
    - Normalize audio channels and sample rates.
- **Considerations**:
    - Balance between quality loss and processing speed.
    - Use efficient transcoding tools (e.g., FFmpeg).

### **4.2 Signature Generation Engine**
- **Purpose**: Create a unique, compact representation (fingerprint) for each video.
- **Techniques**:
    - **Frame Sampling & Hashing**: Sample key frames and compute perceptual hashes.
    - **Temporal Hashing**: Encode the sequence and timing of key frames.
    - **Audio Fingerprinting**: Extract and hash key audio features.
- **Optimizations**:
    - Use robust hash functions that tolerate minor variations (e.g., due to re-encoding or cropping).
    - Store multiple types of signatures (video and audio) for improved accuracy.

### **4.3 Matching Engine**
- **Purpose**: Compare the signature of each video in set V with those stored in the YouTV.com database.
- **Approach**:
    - **Exact and Approximate Matching**: Use algorithms that allow for approximate matching based on similarity thresholds.
    - **Indexing Structures**: Utilize efficient data structures (e.g., Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), inverted indices) to quickly find candidate matches.
    - **Scoring**: Calculate a similarity score for each candidate match to determine if it exceeds a predefined threshold.
- **Considerations**:
    - Handle partial matches where only segments of videos are reused.
    - Provide configurable thresholds to balance sensitivity and specificity.

### **4.4 APIs & User Interface**
- **Upload API**:
    - **Endpoint**: `POST /upload`
    - **Function**: Accept and process the studioâ€™s set V.
- **Matching Query API**:
    - **Endpoint**: `GET /match`
    - **Function**: Return a list of matches from the YouTV.com database for the provided video set.
- **Dashboard**:
    - Visual interface for studios to view reports and details on matched videos.

### **4.5 Reporting & Alerts Module**
- **Function**:
    - Generate detailed reports that include matched video IDs, similarity scores, and timestamps.
    - Provide alert mechanisms (e.g., email notifications, dashboard alerts) when a match is detected.

## **5. Scalability & Performance**
- **Scalability**:
    - Use distributed storage and processing for the video database and signature matching.
    - Implement sharding or partitioning of the video signature database based on video metadata (e.g., upload date, category).
- **Performance**:
    - Cache frequently accessed signatures and matching results.
    - Optimize signature generation and matching algorithms for real-time or near-real-time processing.
- **Latency**:
    - Use asynchronous processing pipelines for video normalization and signature generation.
    - Pre-compute and index signatures for the existing database to speed up comparisons.

---

## **6. Trade-offs**
- **Accuracy vs. Performance**:
    - Higher accuracy in signature generation (e.g., using more frames or detailed audio analysis) can slow down processing.
    - Balancing the trade-off by selecting a subset of frames and combining multiple modalities (video and audio).
- **Storage vs. Speed**:
    - Storing detailed signatures increases storage costs but can reduce matching time.
- **Complexity vs. Robustness**:
    - More complex matching algorithms (e.g., multi-modal comparisons) can yield better results but require more computational resources.

---

## **7. Failure Handling**
- **Video Normalization Failures**:
    - Implement fallbacks to flag and log videos that fail normalization for manual review.
- **Signature Generation Errors**:
    - Retry mechanisms and error logging for failures during fingerprint extraction.
- **High Load / Matching Overload**:
    - Use rate limiting and queue systems to handle peak loads.
    - Provide temporary degraded service with partial matching results while processing backlog.
- **Data Inconsistencies**:
    - Regular integrity checks and audits of the video signature database.

## **8. Real-World Examples**
- **Content ID (YouTube)**:
    - Uses video and audio fingerprinting to detect copyright infringement.
- **Audible Magic**:
    - Provides digital fingerprinting solutions for identifying copyrighted material.

## **Example Walkthrough**

### **Input:**
- **Studio Upload**:
    - A set V containing 10 videos (after normalization and signature generation).
- **Database**:
    - YouTV.com video database with millions of videos, each with pre-computed signatures.

### **Steps:**
1. **Normalization**: Each video in set V is transcoded to the standard format.
2. **Signature Generation**: Compute a perceptual hash for key frames and an audio fingerprint for each video.
3. **Indexing**: Store the signatures in an efficient search structure.
4. **Matching**:
    - For each signature in set V, perform a similarity search against the database.
    - Identify candidate matches based on a similarity score threshold.
5. **Reporting**:
    - Generate a report listing matched video IDs, similarity scores, and details (e.g., matching frames/timestamps).

### **Output:**
```json
{
  "matches": [
    {
      "studioVideoId": "V123",
      "matchedVideoId": "YT987",
      "similarityScore": 0.92,
      "matchDetails": {
        "matchingFrames": [10, 20, 30],
        "audioSimilarity": 0.95

    },
    {
      "studioVideoId": "V124",
      "matchedVideoId": "YT654",
      "similarityScore": 0.88,
      "matchDetails": {
