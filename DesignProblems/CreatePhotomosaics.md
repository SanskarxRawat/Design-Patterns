# Create Photomosaics

A photomosaic is an image that approximates a target picture by arranging many smaller images ("tiles") so that, when viewed from a distance, they resemble the target image. The challenge is to produce high-quality mosaics that closely match the target image while minimizing computation time.

## **1. Clarify Requirements**
- **Functional Requirements:**
    - **Input:**
        - A target image.
        - A large collection of tile images.
    - **Output:**
        - A photomosaic image where each tile is chosen to best represent a region of the target image.
    - **Quality:** The photomosaic should be visually pleasing, with the arrangement of tiles approximating the target image based on human perception.

- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
    - **Compute Efficiency:** Minimal computation time, even with a large tile collection.
    - **Scalability:** Ability to handle high-resolution target images and thousands (or more) tile images.
    - **Memory Efficiency:** Optimize memory usage when processing large images.

- **Key Questions:**
    - How should the “distance” or similarity between a tile and a region of the target image be defined?
    - Should tile images be allowed to be re-used, or must they be unique in the mosaic?
    - Is pre-processing allowed on the tile set to speed up matching?

## **2. Key Components and Overall Approach**
1. **Tile Preprocessing:**
    - **Feature Extraction:** Compute a compact representation (signature) for each tile. This may include average color, color histograms, or even more advanced features (e.g., texture descriptors).
    - **Indexing:** Organize the tile signatures in a data structure (e.g., k-d tree) to facilitate fast nearest-neighbor searches.

2. **Target Image Analysis:**
    - **Segmentation:** Divide the target image into a grid of regions (cells) corresponding to the size of the tiles.
    - **Feature Extraction:** For each cell, compute a signature using the same method as used for the tile images (e.g., average color).

3. **Tile Matching:**
    - **Distance Metric:** Define the distance between two image regions based on their signatures. Common metrics include Euclidean distance between average color vectors or histogram differences.
    - **Matching Algorithm:** For each target cell, quickly find the tile with the minimal distance using the precomputed index.

4. **Assembly and Optimization:**
    - **Tile Placement:** Replace each target region with the best-matching tile.
    - **Post-Processing:** Optionally adjust colors or apply blending to improve visual quality.
    - **Caching:** Cache computed distances for similar regions to reduce redundant computations.

## **3. High-Level Design**
- **Preprocessing Phase (Offline):**
    1. **Extract Signatures for Tiles:**
        - For each tile image, compute a signature (e.g., average RGB values, color histogram, or multi-dimensional features).
    2. **Index the Tile Signatures:**
        - Store signatures in a spatial index (like a k-d tree) to allow fast nearest-neighbor searches.

- **Mosaic Construction Phase (Online):**
    1. **Segment the Target Image:**
        - Divide the target image into grid cells matching the dimensions of the tiles.
    2. **Compute Region Signatures:**
        - For each cell, compute the corresponding signature.
    3. **Tile Matching:**
        - For each region, use the index to find the closest tile (based on the defined distance metric).
    4. **Assemble the Mosaic:**
        - Replace each grid cell with the selected tile.
    5. **Optional Enhancements:**
        - Adjust brightness, contrast, or blend tile boundaries for a smoother visual effect.

## **4. Detailed Considerations**

### **4.1 Defining the Distance Between Two Images**
- **Simple Metric:**
    - **Average Color Distance:** Compute the Euclidean distance between the average RGB values of the target region and the tile.
- **Advanced Metrics:**
    - **Color Histograms:** Compare histograms using metrics like Chi-square or Earth Mover’s Distance.
    - **Multi-Feature Comparison:** Combine several features (e.g., texture, edge information) into a composite distance measure.

### **4.2 Preprocessing Optimizations**
- **Offline Preprocessing:**
    - Precompute and store tile signatures to avoid recalculating them during mosaic construction.
    - Use dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) on tile signatures to reduce index search time.

### **4.3 Matching and Indexing**
- **Indexing Structure:**
    - A k-d tree or ball tree is effective for low-dimensional feature spaces.
- **Approximate Nearest Neighbors:**
    - For further speed, consider using approximate nearest neighbor search methods if slight deviations in quality are acceptable.

### **4.4 Parallelism and Compute Efficiency**
- **Parallel Processing:**
    - The target image can be segmented and processed in parallel across multiple cores or machines.
- **Batch Matching:**
    - Perform tile matching in batches to benefit from vectorized operations or GPU acceleration.

## **5. Trade-Offs**
- **Quality vs. Compute Time:**
    - More complex feature extraction may yield higher-quality mosaics but increases compute time.
    - Approximate nearest neighbor search can greatly speed up matching with minimal loss in visual quality.
- **Granularity of Segmentation:**
    - Finer grids produce more detailed mosaics but require more processing and can lead to visible tile boundaries.

## **6. Example Walkthrough**
### **Scenario:**
- **Tile Set:** 10,000 images, each preprocessed to compute an average color and histogram.
- **Target Image:** High-resolution photograph segmented into a grid of 100 x 100 regions.

### **Processing Steps:**
1. **Preprocessing:**
    - Compute and index the signatures for 10,000 tiles.
2. **Target Analysis:**
    - Divide the target image into 10,000 cells.
    - Compute the average color for each cell.
3. **Tile Matching:**
    - For each cell, use the index to find the tile with the minimum Euclidean distance in average color.
4. **Mosaic Assembly:**
    - Replace each cell with its matching tile.
5. **Post-Processing:**
    - Optionally blend the edges or adjust brightness to improve the overall appearance.

## **7. Summary**
This design produces high-quality photomosaics by leveraging efficient preprocessing, feature extraction, and fast nearest-neighbor matching. By defining the distance between images using perceptually relevant features (such as average color and histograms) and optimizing the matching process with spatial indexes and parallel processing, the system balances visual quality with minimal compute time.
