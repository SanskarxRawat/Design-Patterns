# Design a Solution to the Stemming Problem

## **1. Clarify Requirements**
- **Functional Requirements**:
    - Reduce words to their base or root form (e.g., "running" → "run").
    - Handle multiple languages (e.g., English, Spanish).
- **Non-Functional Requirements**:
    - High accuracy in stemming.
    - Low latency (e.g., < 50ms per word).
    - Scalable to process large volumes of text.
- **Questions to Ask**:
    - What languages need to be supported?
    - Should the solution be rule-based or machine learning-based?
    - Is stemming required for real-time applications (e.g., search engines)?

## **2. Key Components**
1. **Tokenizer**: Split text into words.
2. **Stemming Algorithm**: Reduce words to their root form.
3. **Language Support**: Handle stemming for multiple languages.
4. **APIs**: Expose functionality to users (e.g., `POST /stem`).

---

## **3. High-Level Design**
- **Input**: User submits text.
- **Processing**:
    - Tokenize text into words.
    - Apply stemming algorithm to each word.
- **Output**: List of stemmed words.

## **4. Deep Dive into Critical Components**

### **4.1 Tokenizer**
- Split text into words while handling punctuation, special characters, and whitespace.
- Example: `"I'm running!"` → `["I'm", "running", "!"]`.

### **4.2 Stemming Algorithm**
- **Rule-Based Stemming**:
    - Use predefined rules to remove suffixes (e.g., "ing", "ed").
    - Example: Porter Stemmer (English), Snowball Stemmer (multi-language).
    - **Advantages**: Fast, deterministic, and lightweight.
    - **Limitations**: May over-stem (e.g., "universal" → "univers") or under-stem.
- **Machine Learning-Based Stemming**:
    - Train a model to predict the root form of a word.
    - Example: Use a sequence-to-sequence model or a transformer-based model.
    - **Advantages**: Higher accuracy, especially for irregular words.
    - **Limitations**: Requires labeled data and computational resources.

### **4.3 Language Support**
- Use language-specific stemmers (e.g., Porter Stemmer for English, Snowball Stemmer for Spanish).
- Maintain a mapping of languages to their respective stemmers.

### **4.4 APIs**
- **POST /stem**:
    - Input: `{ "text": "I'm running quickly", "language": "en" }`
    - Output:
      ```json
      {
        "stemmed_text": "I'm run quick"
      }
      ```

## **5. Scalability & Performance**
- **Large Text Volumes**:
    - Use distributed processing (e.g., Apache Spark) to stem large documents in parallel.
- **Latency**:
    - Cache frequently stemmed words (e.g., Redis).
    - Precompute stems for common words.
- **Load Handling**:
    - Use a load balancer to distribute requests across multiple stemming servers.

---

## **6. Trade-offs**
- **Accuracy vs. Speed**:
    - Rule-based stemmers are faster but less accurate.
    - Machine learning-based stemmers are more accurate but slower.
- **Language Support vs. Complexity**:
    - Supporting multiple languages increases complexity but improves usability.

---

## **7. Failure Handling**
- **Stemmer Unavailable**:
    - Fallback to a simpler algorithm (e.g., truncate suffixes).
- **High Load**:
    - Rate limit requests or queue them for batch processing.

---

## **8. Real-World Examples**
- **Search Engines**: Use stemming to improve search results (e.g., Google Search).
- **NLP Pipelines**: Stemming is a preprocessing step for tasks like sentiment analysis.

## **Example Walkthrough**
### Input:
`{ "text": "I'm running quickly", "language": "en" }`

### Steps:
1. Tokenize: `["I'm", "running", "quickly"]`.
2. Apply stemming:
    - "I'm" → "I'm" (no change).
    - "running" → "run".
    - "quickly" → "quick".
3. Output: `"I'm run quick"`.

### Output:
```json
{
  "stemmed_text": "I'm run quick"
}
